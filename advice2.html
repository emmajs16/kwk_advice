      That's totally okay! Most of us at the St. Louis camp never coded before Kode with Klossy. Yes, there will be days when the material will be hard and you will get frustrated from time to time but remember to push through! Don't be afraid to make mistakes and ask those around you for help. You're going to be amazed at how much you learn by the end of the two weeks.
